# v8 component system - smol
Andrew Johnstons JustJS Component Pattern as build Skeletten is mainly used for education
and to have a Central Place to Update the Component Pattern Indipenedent.

## Usage
All Configuration happens in the main.h main.js files the main.cc needs most time no adjustment

## Building for Dummys
While all C++ Developers already out of the box can pray the build steps we still provide them for convinience

```
make all
```

If you need a more Complet Implementation as example look into lemanschik/b8g

## Runtimes Size Comparison
- Deno 108 mb
- Just Dynamic Linked 108 MB
- NodeJS ???
- Chromium Miditeran Platform size ~500mb
- this v8 component system aka smol 83mb
- libv8_monolith 65 mb

## Striped binary executeable Builds
- B8G Minimal Build Static ~???
- Deno Minimal Build Static ~???

## Todo
- use lemanschik/deno-loader and write some benchmarks.
  - publish the benchmarks later
